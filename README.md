The Disk Scheduling Simulator is a web-based tool that helps users understand how disk scheduling algorithms work in a OS. It allows users to enter disk requests, 
choose an algorithm, and see how the disk head moves step by step. The simulator also shows basic performance results like seek time, which makes disk scheduling easy to understand.
